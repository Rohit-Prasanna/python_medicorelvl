Question-1

File Handling is one of the basic important task when it comes to building machine learning models or neural networks. Building a good model always starts with finding datasets and processing it, for which, file handling acts as a stepping stone.

Write a python program that reads the contents from the given file ‘onelinefile.txt’. The file contains a single line which is of the format (int)(string)(float)(string) repeatedly. For e.g.
1Aaa3.5Maths2Bbb4.2Physics3Ccc7.62Chemistry

Your main task is to split the contents of the given file based on their format and write it into a .csv file say ‘Filename2.csv’. For e.g. the above txt file should be converted into a csv file such that the contents look like this:
1,Aaa,3.5,Maths
2,Bbb,4.2,Physics
3,Ccc,7.62,Chemistry

Contents of ‘onelinefile.txt’
